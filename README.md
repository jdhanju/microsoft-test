# Microsoft Screening Problem


## How to run?
- Go inside of the microsoft-test folder
- Run the command `npm start`

## How to run unit tests?
- Run the command `npm test`

## Where is my Problem 1 file?
- `microsoft-test/src/microsoft-p1.js`
- If you would like to test problem 1 separately I have setup a different folder where you can execute problem 1 with node
- Go to the `node` directory
- Run `node microsoft-p1-node` to run your test cases.
- Lines 31-37 in the file `microsoft-p1-node.js` executes my tests. You can go ahead and comment them out or replace them.
